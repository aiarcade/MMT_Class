Internal Examination Pattern:
Each of the two internal examinations has to be conducted out of 50 marks. The first series test
shall be preferably conducted after completing the first half of the syllabus and the second
series test shall be preferably conducted after completing the remaining part of the syllabus.
There will be two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A contains 5 questions (preferably, 2 questions
each from the completed modules and 1 question from the partly completed module), having 3
marks for each question adding up to 15 marks for part A. Students should answer all questions
from Part A. Part B contains 7 questions (preferably, 3 questions each from the completed
modules and 1 question from the partly completed module), each with 7 marks. Out of the 7
questions, a student should answer any 5.

219

End Semester Examination Pattern:
There will be two parts; Part A and Part B. Part A contains 10 questions with 2 questions from
each module, having 3 marks for each question. Students should answer all questions. Part B
contains 2 full questions from each module of which students should answer any one. Each
question can have a maximum 2 subdivisions and carries 14 marks.
